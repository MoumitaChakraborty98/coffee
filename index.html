    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>
    <img src="./images/house blend.jpeg" alt="house blend">
    <p style="width:50%">House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. That is what makes them so unique
    and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the roaster and/or distributor.
    For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The
    one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and
    delicious cup of coffee, period.”</p>

    <h2>French Roast</h2>
    <img src="./images/french-roast.jpeg" alt="french roast">
    <p style="width: 50%">French roast coffee is one of many coffee roasts named for a regional roasting style. It was popular throughout much of
    Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Today, the term is used most often when describing almost any dark-roasted
    coffee.
    
    Sometimes, French roast coffee is also referred to (colorfully) as Turkish roast, (incorrectly) as Espresso roast, or
    (simplistically) as Dark roast.

    <h2>Colombian Roast</h2>

    <p style="width: 50%;">Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the coffee isn't
    actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make both
    light roasts and dark roasts.</p>
