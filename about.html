    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%;">Coffee Junkie is a small independent coffee shop which is all about facilitating avid coffee lovers with hot beverages
    of an impeccable quality and smooth taste. It is a coffee shop built on the principles of loyalty, convenience, and
    relationship.
    <br>
    
    
    Coffee Junkie understands that everyone is on their journey of self-discovery. We want to make their experience simply
    mesmerizing and unforgettable. It is a shop built by a diverse group of people – a perfect combination of friends, and
    family. We care about our respected customers, and we consider them as a part of our ever-growing family.
    <br>
    
    
    The idea of Coffee Junkie did not originate on a spur of the moment. Being passionate lovers of coffee, we wanted a
    place that can give a feeling of a family gathering – a place where people can come, stay for hours, and share happiness
    with their loved ones and everyone around them. The idea originated about Coffee Junkie, and it was just a matter of
    time before we started working on our dream project.</p>
